          your previous submissions. You may upload submissions at any time and

          Find the scrimmages page to request unranked matches with any teams
          listed in the dropdown. Your team may request up to 5 scrimmages per hour.
          These scrimmages do not affect your rating on the leaderboard. Only the matches 
          that we will run periodically throughout the competition affect your rating.
